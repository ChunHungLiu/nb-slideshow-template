# Using the IPython Notebook slideshow mode, an example template

**NOTE** The tools here require IPython 1.0, they do *not* work with
IPython 0.13.2.

This repository contains the executable setup instructions (in the
install-support notebook) as well as an example/template talk, for creating
Notebooks that can be used as a slideshow.

You should run the install-support nb first, it will clone and configure
[this repository](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions)
for you.

This repo consists of basically two notebooks:

1. [The installation/setup code and instructions](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/fperez/nb-slideshow-template/master/install-support.ipynb)

2. [The example slides you can use as a template](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/fperez/nb-slideshow-template/master/notebook-slideshow-example.ipynb)
